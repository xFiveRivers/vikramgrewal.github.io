## Projects

### __DrumTracker__ - __*Drum Loop MIDI Transcription*__

> *Python, PyTorch, TorchAudio, Librosa, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn*

`DrumTracker` is a MIDI transcription tool that extracts timing information of percussion hits from drum loops using a custom deep learning model for prediction and music processing tools for audio segmentation. I got the idea for the project while making music as I'm interested in how different drummers incorporate their own swing to make their grooves unique. It was a chance to explore a deep learning in music and also working specifically with audio data.

### __Lane Line Detection__

> *Python, OpenCV, NumPy*

I wanted to combine my passion for the automotive industry with my skills with programming and math to better understand how advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) work. A common ADAS feature used in nearly all modern cars is `lane detection` which is a computer vision algorithm to detect the lanes of the road in front of the vehicle. It was a great introduction into computer vision as it included data preprocessing and linear algebra algorithms for it to work effectively.

### __Spatial Modeling of Noise Pollution – *(Capstone)*__

> Deep Learning *(Python, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Pandas)*

- Worked in a team to explore the efficacy of spatially modeling noise pollution using a prototype sensor
- Designed CNN and RNN frameworks while leveraging hyperparameter tuning and architecture experimentation to achieve
a model accuracy of 96.5%, an increase of over 40% over baseline strategies

> Data Processing *(Pandas, Python, Altair, Matplotlib, Plotly)*

- Developed a robust preprocessing pipeline, mitigating data inconsistencies and increasing model accuracy by 15%
- Identified abnormal sensor behavior through data visualization and temporal investigation, facilitating early redesign of the
sensor shrouding and revision of sensor network protocols

> Documentation and Visualization *(Altair, Matplotlib, Plotly)*

- Collaborated closely with group members to document and script implementations and algorithms, resulting in a cohesive
final product with seamless integration within the stakeholder’s framework
- Coordinated weekly milestone meetings and delivered a final technical report and presentation to the stakeholder proving
sensor efficacy, resulting in smooth project acceptance and hand-off with high satisfaction
